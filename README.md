#  Case Study "rawg"
1.1- I used MVP architectural patterns to handle the layers of app (network layer, login layer, design layer)
1.2-  I used Singleton design pattern in userdefault and load coredata because we just need one instance in hole app

2 - I think the search part in app need to develop and improve more than now
3 - I like Favorite part in the app becase I worked with coredata
4 - I think the app is ready to submit to appstore
5 - I have no comment
6 - I think app description is greate and there is no missing things. 

## I desgin the screens with just code, I kmow maybe it take more time be it allowe me more flixable  
## I use protocols to connect presenter with viewcontroller to apple `interface segregation principle` in SOLID
